    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and
         character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical 
         thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while 
         others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product 
         of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from
          one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern
           society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal,
 and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning
  is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten,
   primary school and secondary school. ..

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is ISCED level 1.[59] Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven years of formal, 
        structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, 
        and sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was rising.
        [63][full citation needed] Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary 
        education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is quite arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about 
        eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at 
        around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often 
        subdivided into infant schools and junior schools.

In India, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary 
schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the National Council of
 Educational Research and Training..

(U.S. president), Srinivasa Ramanujan (mathematician), Michael Faraday (chemist and physicist), Charles Darwin (naturalist), Thomas Alva Edison (inventor),
 Tadao Ando (architect), George Bernard Shaw (playwright), Frank Zappa (composer, recording engineer, film director), and Leonardo da Vinci (engineer, scientist, mathematician)
